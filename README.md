After registering with server, we get our access key and with this we can use Postmam and access the data and here are the images from Postman:

Able to fetch the data from API by authorising the access key.

I have created controller, router and gave the access key and the server is runninhg but it is loading continuously and I am not able to see the output, but I have created functions for average.
